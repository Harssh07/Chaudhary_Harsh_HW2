#### CSS responsive grid refers to a layout system that allows web developers to create flexible and adaptable grid structures that can adjust and rearrange their content based on different screen sizes and devices. It enables the design and organization of web page elements into columns and rows, providing a framework for creating responsive and mobile-friendly layouts.

The concept of CSS responsive grid is based on the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) properties and techniques to define the structure and behavior of grid elements. The most commonly used CSS properties for building responsive grids are:

1. Display Property: The `display` property is set to `grid` or `inline-grid` to create a grid container. This establishes a new grid formatting context for the child elements.

2. Grid Template Columns and Rows: The `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties define the size and distribution of columns and rows within the grid. You can specify the width or height using fixed values (pixels or percentages), flexible units (fr), or auto.

3. Grid Gap: The `grid-gap` property sets the spacing between columns and rows within the grid. It can be used to create gutters or margins between grid items.

4. Media Queries: Media queries are used to define different CSS rules based on the screen size or device characteristics. By combining media queries with grid properties, you can create breakpoints at which the grid layout adjusts to accommodate different screen sizes.

With the CSS responsive grid concept, you can create layouts that automatically adapt to various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. By defining grid structures and adjusting the layout properties, you can achieve a responsive design that optimizes the user experience and readability on different screens.

Frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, and CSS Grid provide pre-built responsive grid systems that simplify the process of creating responsive layouts. These frameworks offer additional features and utilities to enhance grid functionality, such as responsive breakpoints, alignment options, and responsive typography.
